IMPORTANT CHANGES</h2>
</h2>
    <p>
    In the version 4.2.2 release of the PHP SDK, many refactoring and cleanup changes were
    made to the SDK.&nbsp; For the sake of cleanup, several of these changes are not backwards compatible.&nbsp;
    If you were using an older version of the SDK and wish to use the new version, here
    are the visible changes you need to be aware of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All files under Services/ were moved to /lib</li>
    <li>Services_PayPal has been renamed to PayPal</li>
    <li>paypal-sdk-update no longer available.&nbsp; Whenever there is a new WSDL, a new
        SDK will be released.</li>
    <li>PayPal::getPackageVersion() removed.</li>
    </ul>-->
